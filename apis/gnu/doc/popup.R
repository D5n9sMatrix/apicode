# The solution of Example 1.2.3 is typical of the general case. To solve a linear system, the augmented
# matrix is carried to reduced row-echelon form, and the variables corresponding to the leading ones are
# called leading variables. Because the matrix is in reduced form, each leading variable occurs in exactly
# one equation, so that equation can be solved to give a formula for the leading variable in terms of the
# leading variables. It is customary to call the leading variables “free” variables, and to label them
# by new variables s, t, . . . , called parameters. Hence, as in Example 1.2.3, every variable xi is given by a
# formula in terms of the parameters s and t. Moreover, every choice of these parameters leads to a solution
# to the system, and every solution arises in this way. This procedure works in general, and has come to be

# Gaussian Elimination
# To solve a system of linear equations proceed as follows:
#   1. Carry the augmented matrix to a reduced row-echelon matrix using elementary row
# operations.
# 2. If a row 0 0 0 · · · 0 1 occurs, the system is inconsistent.
# 3. Otherwise, assign the leading variables (if any) as parameters, and use the equations
# corresponding to the reduced row-echelon matrix to solve for the leading variables in terms
# of the parameters.
